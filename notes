narrative for the beginning of the game. 
Today is the first day of a new semester at the iSchool. You are a first year student, \n
and you're on your way to your first class of the day: Information, Organization, and \n
Access, taught by someone named Dr. Sage Blanchard. You've never heard of them, and \n
when you were signing up for classes and researching your professors, you couldn't find \n
any useful information about them online. You aren't sure what to expect. . . .\n\n
press enter to continue
You find your classroom easy enough, but the door is closed and the lights are off.\n
A few other people are standing by the door, reading a piece of paper taped to it.\n
You walk forward and read along with them, and on the paper is a message written neatly\n
in blue ink:\n\n

"Today's class will be a lesson in user experience. Your task is to seek out and locate\n
one of the many copies of our class syllabus that I have hidden around the building. Once \n
you locate one, write your name at the top and place it in the folder below.\n\n
Do not attempt to photocopy a syllabus someone else has already found - I will know.\n\n
Good luck, and I'll see you next week!\n
- Dr. Sage 'Wit' Blanchard"\n\n

You notice a manilla envelope taped to the door below the note. You aren't sure if it had \n
been there a moment before. A few white sheets of printer paper are already in the envelope.\n
"How did people already find copies? It's barely on the hour!" you think to yourself. The \n
longer you wait, however, the more difficult the search will become, so you better get started!\n\n
press enter to continue
