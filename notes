narrative for the beginning of the game. 
Today is the first day of a new semester at the iSchool. You are a first year student, \n
and you're on your way to your first class of the day: Information, Organization, and \n
Access, taught by someone named Dr. Sage Blanchard. You've never heard of them, and \n
when you were signing up for classes and researching your professors, you couldn't find \n
any useful information about them online. You aren't sure what to expect. . . .\n\n
press enter to continue
You find your classroom easy enough, but the door is closed and the lights are off.\n
A few other people are standing by the door, reading a piece of paper taped to it.\n
You walk forward and read along with them, and on the paper is a message written neatly\n
in blue ink:\n\n

"Today's class will be a lesson in user experience. Your task is to seek out and locate\n
one of the many copies of our class syllabus that I have hidden around the building. Once \n
you locate one, write your name at the top and place it in the folder below.\n\n
Do not attempt to photocopy a syllabus someone else has already found - I will know.\n\n
Good luck, and I'll see you next week!\n
- Dr. Sage 'Wit' Blanchard"\n\n

You notice a manilla envelope taped to the door below the note. You aren't sure if it had \n
been there a moment before. A few white sheets of printer paper are already in the envelope.\n
"How did people already find copies? It's barely on the hour!" you think to yourself. The \n
longer you wait, however, the more difficult the search will become, so you better get started!\n\n

- update: figured out how to textwrap. v useful. but also ive been manually doing it, so now i have 
to go back through and fix all of those............... r i p

- to be written:
  - view from your classroom
  - description of...
    - window: You walk over to the window and look out over the iSchool parking lot. It's a warm sunny day in August, with just enough of a breeze to keep you cool. Glancing around the windowsill, you don't see much other than a few leaves that have been tracked in from outside. Finding nothing interesting, you turn back around and decide to look elsewhere. 
    - empty classroom: You step towards the double doors that lead into the lecture hall. They're locked. You notice a piece of paper on the right door that looks similar to the one on your classroom. You read it, and gather that whatever class was supposed to meet here has been sent on a similar quest as your own - another class looking for copies of their syllabi around the building! From the note, it seems this class is . . . 590: Comics: Advising Readers. What an interesting class! You'll have to make sure you don't pick up and turn in one of their syllabi instead of your own. 
    - front office: 
      You walk up to the front office desk. A woman sitting behind the desk greets you with a warm smile.
        'Hello!' she says to you. 'What can I help you with?'
        You ask her if she has any copies of the syllabus for your 501 class. Unfortunately, she does not, and you aren't the first person to ask her that. She advises you to check the kitchen downstairs and the graduate lounge upstairs. Better hurry before your classmates find all the other copies!
    - conference room: You walk over to the set of double doors and try to pull them open, but they are locked. You peer inside, but the lights are off and you can't make anything out other than a long table and a number of office chairs around it in the center of the room. You hope that Dr. Blanchard wouldn't hide a sheet of paper in a locked conference room. 
    - basement landing
    - kitchen
    - CCB
    - lounge
    - help desk

update: gotta go run music bingo!! in the process of adding the descriptions ive written here to the code itself, and making sure the "quit" option is available any time there is an input, and that the formatting is correct (with "\n"s and everything). also re-organizing the functions themselves to be in order of supposed discovery.

update again: i fixed the order and most of the spacing. some descriptions still need to be written (or edited) but im gonna have logan testplay it tomorrow. WOOOOOOO IT WORKS YOU CAN PLAY IT AND YOU CAN WIN IT
