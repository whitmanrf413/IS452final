Here are the instructions!

In this game, you will be given a description of your surroundings and
then prompted to explore. To move in a certain direction, just type
the direction you want to go, and then press enter!

Your choices for directions to explore will be one of the following options:

   ~ forward ~ left ~ right ~ backward ~

 ~ first floor ~ second floor ~ basement ~

If you ever forget what to type or you mistype something, I'll let you
know that I didn't understand you and give you those directions again.

You can also type 'quit' in any prompt to exit the game.
